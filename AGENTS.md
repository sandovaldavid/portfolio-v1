# Repository operating manual for agents

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical repository-working contract for human and AI contributors. Tool-specific instruction files may add only tool or path-specific behavior and must link back here instead of copying these rules.

## 1. Sources of truth

| Concern | Canonical source |
| --- | --- |
| Product and repository overview | [README.md](README.md) |
| Current implementation status | [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) |
| Architecture boundaries | [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and `bun run lint:architecture` |
| Localization and bilingual content | [docs/I18N.md](docs/I18N.md) |
| Tool and dependency versions | [package.json](package.json) and `bun.lock` |
| Testing | [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) |
| CI behavior | [docs/CI.md](docs/CI.md) and `.github/workflows/` |
| Branches, releases and deployment | [docs/DELIVERY.md](docs/DELIVERY.md) |
| Performance budgets | [docs/PERFORMANCE.md](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) and `performance-budgets.json` |
| Documentation ownership | [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) |
| Contribution flow | [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) |

Executable code and configuration override prose when they disagree. Do not copy versions, thresholds, command definitions or architecture rules into a second active document.

## 2. Status discipline

Classify repository statements using the vocabulary in [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md):

- **Implemented:** present in code or configuration and verifiable through the repository;
- **In progress:** partially implemented with an active issue or pull request identifying the remaining work;
- **Blocked:** work or automation cannot proceed because of a named external constraint;
- **Unconfirmed:** plausible but not verified against the current branch or an authoritative result;
- **Deprecated:** still present for compatibility but prohibited for new work;
- **Planned:** approved future work that is not implemented;
- **Historical:** point-in-time context that no longer defines current behavior;
- **Discarded:** explicitly rejected or superseded.

Active repository documentation should describe **Implemented** behavior and only the minimum **In progress**, **Blocked**, **Unconfirmed** or **Deprecated** context needed to operate safely. Decisions, alternatives, historical reasoning, plans and session handoffs belong in the `portfolio-v1` project area of Cortex-L7. Never present an issue, roadmap item or vault note as implemented behavior.

## 3. Branch and pull-request model

The current branch roles are:

- `develop`: integration branch and base for ordinary feature, fix, documentation and maintenance pull requests;
- `main`: default and production branch, updated through a focused promotion pull request from `develop`;
- `resume-assets`: canonical resume artifact branch consumed by preview and production workflows.

Before changing the repository:

1. update local `develop`;
2. read the issue, nearby implementation and owning active documentation;
3. create one short-lived branch from `develop`;
4. identify architecture, bilingual, accessibility and regression-test impact;
5. keep one coherent concern per pull request;
6. open the implementation pull request into `develop`.

Do not work directly on `develop` or `main`. Promotion from `develop` to `main` is a separate release concern governed by [docs/DELIVERY.md](docs/DELIVERY.md).

## 4. Architecture and code

The enforced dependency direction is:

```text
src/pages → app → widgets → features → entities → shared
```

Required practices:

- consume slices through semantic aliases and public `index.ts` APIs;
- do not import peer slices from `widgets`, `features` or `entities`;
- avoid catch-all aliases, deep imports and root layer barrels;
- use strict TypeScript and prefer `unknown` over `any`;
- type component props and non-trivial function boundaries;
- keep Astro route files focused on routing and composition;
- explain non-obvious behavior and trade-offs, not self-evident syntax.

`bun run lint:architecture` is authoritative when prose and implementation disagree. A boundary change requires an executable checker update, affected tests and current operational documentation. Maintainers must synchronize durable rationale and rejected alternatives to Cortex-L7 rather than storing planning history in the repository.

## 5. User-facing and localized changes

- Follow [docs/I18N.md](docs/I18N.md) before adding or moving localized content.
- Classify text as UI copy, structured portfolio content, editorial content or language-neutral data and update only its canonical owner.
- Update English and Spanish together, including visible copy, accessibility labels and localized metadata.
- Do not add monolithic locale files, component-local bilingual copy maps, raw HTML translations or a parallel translation runtime.
- Treat the legacy mixed-value translator and remaining legacy dictionaries as **Deprecated** compatibility code owned by issue #143; do not extend them.
- Preserve keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, reduced-motion behavior and light/dark themes.
- Add browser coverage for interactions, navigation lifecycle or responsive behavior.
- Do not add seniority, impact, coverage or performance claims without verifiable evidence.

## 6. Validation by change type

| Change | Minimum validation |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation only | `bun run check:docs` and `bun run format:check` |
| Pure logic | relevant unit tests plus `bun run test:unit:ci` |
| Astro/UI behavior | relevant Playwright regression plus `bun run test:e2e:smoke` |
| Architecture | `bun run lint:architecture` and affected tests |
| Localization | focused `check:i18n:*`, build, generated-link validation and bilingual smoke coverage |
| Performance/loading | `bun run build`, `bun run performance:check` and relevant browser test |
| CI/tooling | `bun run check`, the changed command locally and workflow review |

Coverage percentages apply only to the scope documented in [docs/testing/UNIT-COVERAGE.md](docs/testing/UNIT-COVERAGE.md).

A missing, skipped, disabled or quota-blocked GitHub Actions run is **not** a successful validation. Record exactly which commands were executed, their environment and their results. When automation is unavailable, local validation is mandatory and the unavailable automation remains **Blocked** or **Unconfirmed**.

## 7. Documentation rules

- Keep the root README concise and recruiter/developer oriented.
- Update the owning active document instead of repeating guidance elsewhere.
- Quantitative claims require a versioned configuration, reproducible command or linked artifact methodology.
- Keep current behavior, installation, configuration, testing, deployment, troubleshooting and contributor contracts in the repository.
- Move decisions, alternatives, reasoning, historical audits, cross-repository strategy, plans and session handoffs to Cortex-L7.
- Do not add a repository archive for material that belongs in the vault; Git history remains the public change record.
- Run `bun run check:docs` after changing links or moving files.

## 8. Git and pull requests

Use Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

Common branch prefixes are `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `perf/`, `test/`, `chore/`, `ci/`, `deps/`, `security/` and `agent/`.

A pull request should state:

- what changed and why;
- user or developer impact;
- validation performed, including commands and environment;
- risks, trade-offs or intentionally deferred work;
- `Closes #<issue>` only when the merge completes that issue.

Use squash merge so the validated pull-request title becomes the integration commit. Do not merge unless explicitly requested. Before marking a pull request ready, confirm that it targets the intended branch, contains no unrelated changes and has the strongest validation currently available.

## 9. Canonical local gate

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run check
bun run test:unit:ci
bun run build
```

Add the relevant generated-link, Playwright, Lighthouse, Docker visual or performance command based on the change. Exact command definitions live in [package.json](package.json).
