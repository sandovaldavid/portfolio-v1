## Current implementation

- **Delivery:** Astro generates a static site; JavaScript is used for progressive interactions and client-navigation lifecycle behavior.
- **Architecture:** dependencies follow `src/pages → app → widgets → features → entities → shared` and are checked by `bun run lint:architecture`.
- **Localization:** English is unprefixed and Spanish uses `/es`; granular UI catalogs, localized Content Collections, metadata and generated-route checks enforce the bilingual contract.
- **Quality:** repository checks, unit tests, Playwright, Axe, route budgets and Lighthouse commands are versioned in the repository.
- **Development environment:** a pinned Playwright/Bun Dev Container supports the complete local validation workflow.
- **Deployment:** `develop` is the integration branch; `main` is the default and production branch. Promotion to `main` is handled through a separate pull request.

The remaining legacy localization compatibility paths are tracked by issue #143 and are documented as **Deprecated/In progress**, not as the supported path for new work. See [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md).

## Quality gates

| Area | Repository contract |
| --- | --- |
| Formatting, lint and types | `bun run check` |
| Documentation links | `bun run check:docs` |
| Unit behavior | `bun run test:unit:ci` and the scoped coverage command |
| Production output | `bun run build` and `bun run check:links` |
| Browser and accessibility flows | Playwright smoke, desktop, extended and visual commands |
| Performance | route budgets and Lighthouse commands |
| Development environment | `bun run check:devcontainer` |

GitHub workflow definitions automate selected promotion, production and scheduled gates. A missing, disabled or quota-blocked workflow run is not validation evidence; pull requests must list the commands that actually ran.

## Architecture

```text
src/pages → src/app → src/widgets → src/features → src/entities → src/shared
```

Astro route files are framework entry points. Product code consumes lower layers through semantic aliases and slice public APIs. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the executable rules.

## Local development

Use the Bun version declared by `packageManager` in [package.json](package.json).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandovaldavid/portfolio-v1.git
cd portfolio-v1
git switch develop
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

Canonical validation:

```bash
bun run check
bun run test:unit:ci
bun run build
```

Add generated-link, browser, performance or visual validation according to [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).
