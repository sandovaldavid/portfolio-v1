# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Keep changes focused, reproducible and aligned with the current repository documentation.

## Setup

Use the Bun version declared in [package.json](package.json).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandovaldavid/portfolio-v1.git
cd portfolio-v1
git switch develop
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

The recommended environment is the Dev Container documented in [docs/DEVCONTAINER.md](docs/DEVCONTAINER.md).

## Branch workflow

1. Update `develop` and create a short-lived prefixed branch from it.
2. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) and the owning document for the area being changed.
3. Implement one coherent concern without expanding deprecated compatibility paths.
4. Add the relevant unit or browser regression.
5. For user-facing content, follow [docs/I18N.md](docs/I18N.md), update English and Spanish together and include accessibility and metadata copy.
6. Run the canonical local checks and every change-specific check.
7. Open a pull request into `develop` using a Conventional Commit title.
8. Record exact validation commands, environment and results in the pull request.
9. Squash merge only after review and explicit authorization.

`main` is the default and production branch. Promotion from `develop` to `main` is a separate pull request governed by [docs/DELIVERY.md](docs/DELIVERY.md); ordinary feature branches do not target `main` directly.

## Canonical validation

```bash
bun run check
bun run test:unit:ci
bun run build
```

Add `bun run check:links`, the relevant Playwright command, route budgets, Lighthouse or pinned-Docker visual validation according to [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

A missing, skipped, disabled or quota-blocked GitHub Actions run is not a pass. When automation is unavailable, local validation remains mandatory and the unavailable automation must be reported as **Blocked** or **Unconfirmed**.

## Pull requests

A pull request should include:

- the problem and verified current state;
- the chosen solution and its impact;
- validation performed, including commands and environment;
- risks, trade-offs or intentionally deferred work;
- screenshots for visible changes;
- `Closes #<issue>` only when the merge completes that issue.

Do not weaken architecture, localization, testing, accessibility or performance gates merely to make a check pass. Update configuration only with evidence and a documented operational reason.

## Documentation

[docs/README.md](docs/README.md) defines ownership, status classification and the repository/Cortex-L7 boundary.

Keep in the repository:

- current behavior and architecture;
- installation, configuration and development instructions;
- testing, deployment and troubleshooting contracts;
- conventions required by contributors and agents.

Keep in Cortex-L7:

- decisions and alternatives;
- historical reasoning and audits;
- cross-repository strategy;
- plans and session handoffs;
- private or durable context that should survive repository refactors.

Do not document an issue, roadmap item or vault note as existing functionality. Update the canonical owner and run `bun run check:docs` after changing links or moving files.

## Conduct

Be respectful, keep reviews specific and evidence-based, and separate technical disagreement from personal criticism.
