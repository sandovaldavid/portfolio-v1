# Widget slice catalog

This catalog is an operational inventory of the current slices under `src/widgets/`. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) owns dependency rules; source code and public APIs own exact dependencies and call sites.

Widgets compose page sections from features, entities and shared primitives. They must not import peer widgets.

| Slice | Current purpose | Mount status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `about-content` | Standalone About page content built from localized profile data. | Mounted by localized About routes. |
| `about-me` | Home-page profile summary and About link. | Mounted on localized home routes. |
| `badges` | Certification-badge collection backed by the badge entity. | Implemented but not mounted by a production route. |
| `blog` | Blog cards and full editorial detail rendering. | Mounted by localized blog routes. |
| `contact-sidebar` | Persistent social/contact shortcuts. | Composed by the application layout. |
| `devlog` | Devlog cards and full entry rendering. | Mounted by localized devlog routes. |
| `experience` | Localized tabbed professional-experience section. | Mounted on localized home routes. |
| `footer` | Site footer and social links. | Composed by the application layout. |
| `header` | Brand, primary navigation, resume action, language control and mobile navigation. | Composed by the application layout. |
| `hero` | Home-page professional introduction and primary evidence links. | Mounted on localized home routes. |
| `project-case-study` | Structured project problem, approach, trade-offs and outcome detail. | Mounted by localized project detail routes. |
| `projects` | Featured or complete project-card collection. | Mounted by home and project-index routes. |
| `recruiter-hud` | Optional recruiter controls, theme/language access and retro interaction utilities. | Composed by the application layout. |
| `research` | Home-page research summary. | Mounted on localized home routes. |
| `research-content` | Standalone research page content. | Mounted by localized research routes. |
| `tech-stack` | Curated technology overview and skills navigation. | Composed by the home layout. |
| `vision` | Future-facing portfolio cards. | Implemented but not mounted by a production route. |

“Implemented but not mounted” means source code exists but is not current user-facing behavior. Do not market or document those slices as live features unless a production consumer and regression coverage are added.

## Maintenance rules

When adding or changing a widget:

1. keep routing in `src/pages` and cross-page shell composition in `src/app`;
2. import features, entities and shared code through public APIs;
3. do not import another widget or an app layout from a widget;
4. load localized structured data through the owning entity and reusable UI copy through granular catalogs;
5. keep one unique page `<h1>` and preserve semantic heading order;
6. add browser coverage for changed rendering, responsive behavior or client-navigation lifecycle;
7. update this inventory only when a slice is added, removed, repurposed or mounted/unmounted;
8. run `bun run lint:architecture` and the relevant test command.
