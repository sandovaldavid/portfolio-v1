# Documentation index and ownership

English is the primary repository documentation language. Spanish is maintained for the root project guide and user-facing content.

Catalogs describe current slices but do not redefine architecture rules.

## Repository and Cortex-L7 boundary

### The repository owns

- implemented behavior and current architecture;
- public contracts and canonical source locations;
- installation, configuration and development instructions;
- test commands, expected gates and troubleshooting;
- workflow definitions, deployment behavior and release procedure;
- conventions required by contributors and coding agents.

### Cortex-L7 owns

- decisions and rejected alternatives;
- reasoning, consequences and historical context;
- private evidence and knowledge that should not be published;
- cross-repository strategy;
- plans, backlogs that are not GitHub issues and session handoffs;
- consolidated context from completed audits and migrations.

A repository document may link to a public issue or pull request for current work, but it must remain usable without access to the private vault. Git history, merged pull requests, closed issues and `CHANGELOG.md` remain the public historical record.

## Status classification

Use the definitions in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md):

- **Implemented** for verifiable current behavior;
- **In progress** for partially implemented work with a concrete active issue or PR;
- **Blocked** for a named external constraint;
- **Unconfirmed** for facts not verified against current authoritative state;
- **Deprecated** for compatibility code that must not gain new consumers;
- **Planned**, **Historical** and **Discarded** for context that belongs in GitHub planning/history or Cortex-L7 rather than active behavior documentation.

Do not describe an issue, roadmap item, previous audit or vault decision as implemented functionality.

## Ownership and update policy

1. Update the owning document instead of copying guidance elsewhere.
2. `package.json`, `bun.lock` and executable configuration own versions, commands and thresholds.
3. Quantitative statements require a reproducible command, versioned configuration or artifact methodology.
4. Tool-specific instruction files may contain only tool/path deltas and must reference [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
5. Keep only operational consequences of a decision in repository documentation; synchronize durable rationale and alternatives to Cortex-L7.
6. Update [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) when an item changes classification.
7. Run `bun run check:docs` after adding, removing or moving documentation.

Any pull request changing behavior must update the owning document in the same change when the operational contract changes.
