# Current implementation status

This document classifies repository-level statements as of **2026-07-24**. It is an operational snapshot, not a roadmap. Code, configuration and executable checks remain authoritative.

## Status vocabulary

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Implemented** | Present in the current `develop` source or versioned configuration and directly verifiable. |
| **In progress** | Partially implemented; an open issue identifies concrete remaining work. |
| **Planned** | Approved future work with no current implementation. |
| **Blocked** | Work or automation cannot proceed because of a named external constraint. |
| **Deprecated** | Still present for compatibility but prohibited for new work. |
| **Historical** | Point-in-time evidence or context that no longer defines current behavior. |
| **Discarded** | Explicitly rejected or superseded. |
| **Unconfirmed** | Not verified against the current branch, repository settings or an authoritative result. |

## Implemented

| Area | Verified repository evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Static site | Astro build scripts and static route implementation. |
| Toolchain | Bun is pinned through `packageManager`; dependencies and scripts are defined in `package.json` and resolved by `bun.lock`. |
| Architecture | Pragmatic Feature-Sliced Design with executable import-boundary checks. |
| Localization architecture | English-default and `/es` routing, granular typed UI catalogs, localized profile/experience/research/project/editorial content and Astro-native route helpers. |
| Localization enforcement | Source catalog/content/copy checks, generated-route checks, bilingual browser coverage and unit regressions that prohibit the removed legacy runtime. |
| Testing | Vitest unit tests, Playwright browser suites, Axe accessibility gates and pinned-Docker visual comparison. |
| Performance | Route-level budgets, bundle reporting and Lighthouse commands. |
| Development environment | Versioned Dev Container with pinned Bun and Playwright, non-root user, Docker access and lifecycle validation. |
| Workflow definitions | Pull-request CI/preview workflows for `main`, post-integration quality, scheduled quality, CodeQL and production deployment definitions. |
| Branch roles | `develop` is the current integration base; `main` is the default and production branch; `resume-assets` supplies canonical CV artifacts. |

The localization runtime no longer contains monolithic locale dictionaries, the flattened mixed-value translator, `useTranslations()`, `useTranslationsList()`, duplicated Atena/Skills/Components route implementations or the six-file hardcoded-copy debt baseline.

## In progress

| Area | Remaining work |
| --- | --- |
| i18n roadmap closure | Issue #144 must record completion of #143 and close after final validation and merge. |

No other roadmap item is documented here as implemented functionality.

## Deprecated

No localization compatibility runtime remains. Reintroducing monolithic locale files, mixed scalar/array translators, manual locale-prefix helpers or direct locale imports is prohibited and covered by executable checks.

## Blocked

- GitHub Actions execution may be unavailable because workflows are disabled or account minutes are exhausted. This blocks hosted automation evidence, not local development or local validation.
- A blocked or absent workflow run must never be described as passed.

Update this section when hosted automation is restored and verified.

## Unconfirmed

The following GitHub-hosted settings are not versioned in the repository and must be verified in the GitHub UI when relevant:

- current branch rulesets and required-check configuration;
- automatic branch deletion and permitted merge methods;
- current workflow enablement and available Actions quota;
- Vercel environment secrets and deployment-environment protection.

Repository documentation defines the intended contract but does not claim these settings are active without verification.

## Discarded or superseded

The following policies no longer define current work:

- treating `main` as the base for every ordinary implementation branch;
- deleting or avoiding the long-lived `develop` integration branch;
- routine automated beta tags and release pull requests for ordinary site changes;
- total `dist/` size as the blocking performance budget;
- global `prefetchAll` for every internal link.

## Historical

Point-in-time audits, completed branch plans, migration rationale and prior test snapshots have been removed from the active documentation tree. Their durable context belongs in Cortex-L7, while Git history, merged pull requests, closed issues and `CHANGELOG.md` remain public historical evidence.

## Update rule

Update this file in the same pull request when an item changes category. A status change requires repository evidence or a linked issue/PR; it must not rely only on intention or a vault note.
