## ✅ Manual Steps Completed

### VERCEL_TOKEN Configuration
- [x] Create Vercel personal access token
- [x] Configure token in repository secrets (`VERCEL_TOKEN`)

### Branch Protection Rules
- [x] Configured Rulesets for `main` and `develop` branches using the GitHub API (via gh CLI).
  - `main`: Requires PR with 1 review, stale review dismissal, Code Owners approval, conversation resolution, and successful deployments to `Production`. Strict status checks (`validate` and `deploy`) are enforced.
  - `develop`: Requires PR (0 approvals), stale review dismissal, and strict status checks (`validate` and `deploy`) to pass before merging.

---

## 🧪 Test the Setup

Now that the configuration is complete, here is how to test the workflows:

1. **Create a test branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/workflow-validation
   ```

2. **Make a small change:**
   ```bash
   echo "# Test" >> test.txt
   ```

3. **Commit with valid message:**
   ```bash
   git add test.txt
   git commit -m "test: validate ci/cd workflow"
   ```

4. **Push and create PR to develop:**
   ```bash
   git push origin test/workflow-validation
   ```

5. **Watch GitHub Actions run:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/sandovaldavid/portfolio-v1/actions
   - You should see: `Validate PR` workflow running
   - ESLint, Prettier check, and build should all pass
   - Preview deployment should start automatically

6. **Merge to main (when ready):**
   - Create PR from `develop` to `main`
   - Verify all checks pass
   - Merge to trigger production deployment

## 🚀 Once Everything is Setup

Your CI/CD pipeline will work as follows:

```
Feature Branch (feat/xyz)
    ↓ Create PR to develop
    
GitHub Actions Runs:
├─ ✅ ESLint
├─ ✅ Prettier format check
├─ ✅ Type check (astro check)
├─ ✅ Build
└─ 🚀 Deploy preview to Vercel

Code Review & Merge to develop
    ↓
Develop auto-deploys preview
    ↓
When ready, create PR develop → main
    
GitHub Actions Runs:
├─ ✅ All checks again
├─ 🚀 Deploy production to Vercel
└─ 📧 Slack notification (optional)

Production live at: sandovaldavid.com
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "VERCEL_TOKEN secret not found"
- Add the secret: `gh secret set VERCEL_TOKEN`
- Verify: `gh secret list | grep VERCEL`

### "Preview deployment not showing in PR"
- Check GitHub Actions logs: Actions tab
- Verify VERCEL_TOKEN is set correctly
- Check Vercel dashboard for deployment status

### "Build fails in CI but works locally"
- Run locally: `bun run build`
- Run linter: `bun run lint`
- Run formatter: `bun run format`
- Fix any issues and commit

### "Branch protection rules don't work"
- Repository must be **private** with **GitHub Pro**
- OR set up manually via Settings → Branches
